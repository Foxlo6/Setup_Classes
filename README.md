# Setup_Classes


A simple script, made to build the boring part of classes during OOP. Nothing to special, but maybe usefull in some cases. Currently supports php and python.


# Planned features:

- Implementation in more languages, not only python and php.
 
- A way of building some basic object-inheritance.

- Maybe some kind of themes for the GUI?


# Dependencies

Nothing on Windows 11.

Python 3.13 with the tkinter & keyboard libraries at every other OS.


# Disclaimer

The writen output is optimized for Notepad++ (php) and Pycharm Community-Edition (Python).
